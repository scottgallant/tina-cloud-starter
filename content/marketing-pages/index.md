      TinaCMS system that enables you to focus on building sites the way you're

    diagramDescription: >-
      Here is the architecture for this Next.js app. When deployed, your admin
      routes will be protected by the Tina wrapper, which requires you to
      authenticate with Tina Cloud. Otherwise, the non-admin page and the admin
      page should be identical, using the same query and rendering the same
      components.
